                            <h1 >Lewis Hamilton</h1>
                            <p>Lewis Hamilton set himself on a path to Formula One when he introduced himself to McLaren team boss Ron Dennis at an award ceremony in 1995. The nine year-old walked up to Dennis, asked for his autograph and said: “Hi. I’m Lewis Hamilton. I won the British championship and one day I want to be racing your cars.”</p>
                            <p>It earned Hamilton the patronage and support of one of the top Formula One teams which, 13 years later, resulted in an F1 drive. Hamilton went on to equal and then outstrip the achievement of his hero Ayrton Senna, a former McLaren driver, by winning three championship titles.</p>
                            <p>Before that there was the small matter of graduating through the lower echelons of motorsport, which Hamilton achieved with some astonishing successes.</p>

                            <p>Valtteri Bottas made his Formula One race debut for Williams in 2013.</p>
                            <p>Bottas joined the team in 2010, taking over from Nico Hulkenberg as their test and reserve driver. After winning the 2011 GP3 championship he spent a year out of racing but appeared in practice sessions at official F1 weekends in 15 of the 20 rounds.</p>
                            <p>Bottas said this was the best preparation a young driver could get at the time due to the ban on in-season testing. The team were sufficiently impressed with his performance to drop Bruno Senna in favour of him at the end of 2012.</p>

                            <h1>Max Verstappen</h1>
                            <p>Max Verstappen caused a stir by gaining a place in Formula One just eight months after starting his first car race.</p>
                            <p>The son of Jos Verstappen, who was the first Dutchman to stand on a Formula One podium, and kart racer Sophie-Marie Kumpen, Max used a hugely successful karting campaign in 2013 as a springboard to start his single-seater racing career.</p>
                            <p>The elder Verstappen bowed out of F1 in 2003, and two years later seven-year-old Max scored his first karting victories in Belgium. This began a remarkable unbeaten streak running across three seasons, first in the Belgian ‘mini’ championship for two years, then after moving up to the ‘mini max’ category.</p>
                            <p>Further titles followed in 2008 including the Belgian Cadet Championship as Verstappen, now 11, began to ascend the karting ladder. A move up to the international level did little to put him off his stride, as he won the WSK World Series KF3 and the Euro title as well – the latter crown he retained the following year.</p>
                            <p>In 2012 he continued to compete across a variety of karting categories and enjoyed mixed success. But he came of age the following season, amassing a daunting collection of trophies. Among them were the CIK-FIA KZ world championship title, won against several highly-rated rivals including former F1 driver Jaime Alguersuari.</p>
                            <p>Verstappen added the KF and KZ European titles as well, lifted the WSK Euro Series KZ1 and WSK Master Series KZ2 crowns, and added the KF2 Winter Cup too. On the back of one of the most impressive karting campaigns of recent years Verstappen, who turned 16 that September, prepared to move up to slicks-and-wings racing.</p>
                            <p>His first stop was the 2014 Florida Winter Series, which comprised a dozen races run over four weeks at the beginning of the year. He made an inauspicious start when he crashed into Antonio Fuoco in the pits shortly after the first session started. But Verstappen won twice in a field which included drivers who had raced in Formula Renault 2.0 and Formula Three. Unusually, the series did not produce an overall champion, having no ranking system.</p>
                            <p>Those two categories were potential destinations for his 2014 campaign. Verstappen tested both machines, but following a highly promising run in a German Formula Three Cup car he chose to take the plunge in the most competitive Formula Three championship – the Europe-wide series.</p>
                            <p>Driving for the same Van Amersfoort team his father once raced for, the younger Verstappen won in his second F3 weekend. Soon after he hit a rich vein of form, reeling off six consecutive victories, all scored at Spa-Francorchamps and the Norisring.</p>
                            <p>A seventh straight win followed in the prestigious Masters of F3 on home ground at Zandvoort, though it didn’t count towards the championship. Verstappen’s Lotus-backed rival Esteban Ocon retained a 74-point lead in the drivers’ standings, partly thanks to superior reliability from his car. Ocon pulled over 100 points clear with a hat-trick of his own the following weekend in Moscow.</p>
                            <p>Verstappen failed to capitalise when Ocon endured a point-less weekend at the Red Bull Ring, due in part to a controversial penalty following contact with Antonio Fuoco. Red Bull, however, had seen enough of his potential to make their move.</p>
                            <p>Mercedes were also showing an interest in the young driver, but on August 12th Verstappen was announced as the latest addition to Red Bull’s junior driver programme. That roster already included two drivers who were leading their championships – Carlos Sainz Jnr in Formula Renault 3.5 and Alex Lynn in GP3 – plus promising Formula Renault 3.5 rookie Pierre Gasly.</p>
                            <p>But just six days after Red Bull revealed Verstappen had joined their ranks came the surprise announcement that he would race for their junior team Toro Rosso in 2015, replacing Jean-Eric Vergne. By the end of the year he had made three appearances in F1 practice sessions in preparation for his debut at the record-breaking age of 17.</p>

                            <p>Sergio Perez – often referred to by his nickname Checo – made his F1 debut for Sauber in 2011 and before the end of his second season he’d signed to drive for McLaren. However that proved to be a short-lived relationship.</p>
                            <p>Perez started karting in 1996. In 2004, with the support of prominent Mexican businessman Carlos Slim’s Escuderia Telmex, he began racing in the Skip Barber series in the USA.</p>
                            <p>The following year he moved to Europe and spent two years in the German Formula BMW championship.</p>
                            <p>Arriving in Britain in 2007 he raced for T-Sport, winning the national (junior) championship that year before graduating into the main series. He began his 2008 campaign strongly with three wins in the first six races, but faded to fourth by the end of the season.</p>
                            <p>He moved up to GP2 the following year, finishing on the podium in both races at Valencia and ending the year 12th. Switching from Arden to Addax he had a stronger 2010, but was beaten to the title by Pastor Maldonado.</p>
                            <p>Before the season was over he was signed by Sauber to partner Kamui Kobayashi in 2011. He also joined the driver development programme of Sauber’s engine supplier Ferrari.</p>

                            <p>Daniel Ricciardo reached Formula One through Red Bull’s young driver programme. He was promoted to their F1 team in 2014 and scored three wins in his first year at the top team.</p>
                            <p>Ricciardo’s father was born in Sicily but emigrated to Australia at the age of eight. “I think Europe at the time was a bit difficult and a bit dark,” explained Ricciardo in 2017. “It was difficult to get ahead and I think they just thought Australia was a place of opportunity.”</p>
                            <p>However Ricciardo returned to Europe in order to make his way up the motor racing ladder. He won the British F3 championship in 2009 and progressed to Formula Renault 3.5 the following year. He finished two points behind champion Mikhail Aleshin following a setback late in the season when his car was flipped over at Silverstone.</p>
                            <p>Ricciardo drove for Red Bull in the post-season rookie test that year and again in 2010. He remained in Formula Renault 3.5 for 2011 but dovetailed it with increasing F1 commitments. This included participating in Friday first practice sessions for Red Bull’s sister team Toro Rosso.</p>

                            <p>Lando Norris was appointed as McLaren’s test and reserve driver at the age of 17. An impressive performance for the team in testing at the Hungaroring in 2017 earned him the position in place of the team’s outgoing driver, 2009 world champion Jenson Button.</p>
                            <p>Like Button, Norris sampled a kart for the first time at Clay Pigeon kart track. Aged seven, Norris and his older brother Oliver (10), began competing in karting races soon afterwards.</p>
                            <p>The Norris boys enjoyed the backing of father Adam Norris, a director at financial services company Hargreaves Lansdown who later set up his own investment company. In 2016 he was estimated to have a wealth in excess of £200 million.</p>
                            <p>At one stage Lando Norris competed in both the KF and Rotax karting categories, at his father’s encouragement, to broaden his experience and give him a feel for different kinds of equipment and tyres. The intensive programme paid off and Lando delivered an impressive string of titles.</p>
                            <p>He clinched the 2013 WSK Euro series with a round to go. Although he missed out on the European KF title the following year he struck back in 2014, winning the world KF championship title.</p>

                            <p>Being the son of a two-times World Rally Champion and earning the support of Red Bull gave Carlos Sainz a strong chance of gaining a place in F1. However for a while it seemed he might miss out on that opportunity.</p>
                            <p>Leading the Formula Renault 3.5 series in mid-2014, Sainz’s prospects looked very good. But the emerging talent of Formula Three driver Max Verstappen put a spanner in the works: Red Bull signed him up to their young driver programme alongside Sainz, and immediately gave Verstappen their sole vacant F1 seat at Toro Rosso for 2015.</p>

                            <p>Back-to-back championship successes in GP3 and Formula Two made Charles Leclerc an obvious choice for an F1 seat at Sauber in 2018.</p>
                            <p>He had his first run in a kart thanks to childhood friend Jules Bianchi. Leclerc, the younger of the pair by seven years, showed similar skills at the wheel and followed his friend’s path towards F1.</p>
                            <p>In 2009 Leclerc became the youngest-ever winner of France’s cadet karting championship. Two years later Nicolas Todt, Bianchi’s manager, signed Leclerc up. This was a pivotal moment, as without Todt’s backing Leclerc doubted his family could have afforded to keep supporting him.</p>
                            <p>He went on to enjoy success on the international stage, though he narrowly missed out on several major titles. In 2012 he was runner-up in the European KF2 series and the under 18 world championship. The following year Max Verstappen beat him to the KZ1 world title.</p>
                            <p>Nonetheless Leclerc showed clear potential and was ready to move up to racing cars. While Verstappen went straight into F3 Leclerc took smaller steps up the F1 ladder.</p>

                            <p>Esteban Ocon was only 17 years old when he won the European Formula Three championship in 2014. Yet his even younger F3 rival Max Verstappen gained a place in Formula 1 more quickly, making his debut with Toro Rosso the following season.</p>
                            <p>Ocon had reached F3 after two season in Formula Renault 2.0, taking a strong second in the Eurocup in 2013 by winning two of the final three races. While Verstappen took a few rounds to come good and was hampered by some engine problems, Ocon put the championship beyond doubt with relentless points-scoring. In a 17-race period he finished in the top two 15 times.</p>
                            <p>After that Ocon made what appeared to be a sideways move into GP3. He had impressed Lotus in a one-off F1 practice outing for the team at the end of 2014, but needed to keep the results coming to sustain the interest of the top F1 teams.</p>

                            <p>Pierre Gasly was handed his F1 debut with Toro Rosso at the 2017 Malaysian Grand Prix, though at one stage he had been hopeful of beginning the season with Red Bull’s junior team.</p>
                            <p>Gasly was in his fourth year on Red Bull’s junior driver team. He began racing in the French Formula Four championship at the age of 15, finishing runner-up to Matthieu Vaxiviere and Andrea Pizzitola, then moved into Formula Renault 2.0.</p>
                            <p>His breakthrough came in his second year of racing in the Formula Renault 2.0 Eurocup. Gasly prevailed in a close and sometimes acrimonious season-long battle with Oliver Rowland. The pair collided in Russia and at the season finale at the Circuit de Catalunya. Rowland’s penalty for the latter collision sealed the title for Gasly.</p>

                            <p>Yuki Tsunoda began karting at the age of four, after watching his father compete in a Japanese local racing series at Nakai Inner Circuit. He progressed up the ranks of Japanese karting, before moving to cars with a step up to national F4 in 2016.</p>
                            <p>Tsunoda drove for Carlin in F2, where another slightly mixed start to his season turned into a strong run from the fourth round onwards. He took wins at Silverstone and Spa, moving to fight for second in the championship in the latter half of the season.</p>
                            <p>Late in the year Red Bull gave Tsunoda the chance to drive a Formula 1 car for the first time at a private test day at Imola for AlphaTauri. He duly completed the 300 kilometres of running necessary for a free practice licence.</p>
                            <p>Heading into the final rounds of a competitive F2 season and with a possible promotion to F1 with AlphaTauri in sight, Tsunoda still needed to guarantee a high enough placing in the drivers’ championship to secure an F1 superlicence. Following a setback in the penultimate double-header in Bahrain, he came away from the final round with a win and a second place, cementing third in the championship. The result also confirmed him as the series’ top rookie, earning the Anthoine Hubert trophy.</p>
                            <p>Following a further test for AlphaTauri as Yas Marina, the team confirmed he will join Pierre Gasly at their F1 team in 2021.</p>

                            <p>The following season he was fifth in the Formula Three Euroseries. The championship was dominated by Lewis Hamilton and ASM – Vettel’s ASL team didn’t win a single race, though he was the top rookie.</p>
                            <p>Thanks to his BMW connections Vettel made his debut as an F1 tester for the Williams team. Still aged only 18, he had to ask his school teacher for time off to do the test.</p>
                            <p>The following year Vettel joined Paul di Resta at ASM but finished second to his team mate in the championship. A debut appearance in the World Series by Renault proved much more fruitful – Vettel won both races at Misano.</p>
                            <p>He also appeared at the next round at Spa but badly injured his hand in a 170mph crash. His right index finger was almost severed and had to be stitched back together.</p>

                            <h1>Lance Stroll</h1>
                            <p>Lance Stroll was a mere 11 years old when Ferrari signed him to their driver academy in 2010. From that point it seemed inevitable he would eventually make it into Formula One, but when the opportunity came it was with one of their rivals.</p>
                            <p>Stroll joined Williams as a development driver at the end of 2015 and gained a place in their race team two years later. It was a fitting move as Canada’s last F1 driver, Jacques Villeneuve, won the world championship with them in 1997.</p>
                            <p>In the intervening period Stroll’s path through the junior categories attracted positive and negative attention.</p>
                            <p>The latter arose chiefly from the investment of his father Lawrence Stroll, a billionaire who made his wealth through fashion brands such as Polo Ralph Lauren, Tommy Hilfiger and Michael Kors. His earnings, which had previously gone into amassing an enviable collection of Ferrari road cars, were now ploughed into his son’s racing career.</p>

                            <p>Kimi Raikkonen started karting in 1987 and after several successes in the Finnish series moved up to compete at international level.</p>
                            <p>His first step into car racing was tentative: After a handful of starts in the 1999 British Formula Renault series he decided his Mygale chassis was too uncompetitive and returned to karting. He reappeared in Britain to compete in the Formula Ford Festival and then won the Formula Renault Winter Series.</p>
                            <p>That set him up for a return to Formula Renault with top team Manor. “Kimi had stayed in karts a long time,” team boss John Booth recalled, “mainly because he couldn’t raise the money to get out of it until the Robertsons got involved.” Dave and Steve Robertson, father and son, managed Raikkonen’s career.</p>
                            <p>Raikkonen started the season with third place and then a victory in the first two races. He added six more championships to clinch the title, and left the championship two races before the end of the season with the title already won.</p>

                            <p>Antonio Giovinazzi received a surprise call-up to make his Formula One race debut for Sauber on the eve of the first race of 2017. However the Italian driver had already impressively scaled the junior racing ranks and been hired by Ferrari as a test driver.</p>
                            <p>Born in the southern Italian town of Martina France, Giovinazzi enjoyed his first racing success in the Formula Pilota China series, winning the title with Eurasia. He also raced competitively closer to home in Formula Abarth and made the step up to F3 at the age of 19.</p>
                            <p>A dual campaign in the European and British championships meant he was kept busy, but results came slowly with Double R in the European series. He won twice in Britain and ended the year second overall behind Jordan King.</p>

                            <h1>Mick Schumacher</h1>
                            <p>As the son of Michael Schumacher, Formula 1’s most successful driver of all time, Mick Schumacher was always going to face immense public attention when he made his first steps into motor racing.</p>
                            <p>Realising the pressure it would heap on the young racer, his family initially entered him for events using the surname Betsch, the maiden name of his mother Corinna Schumacher, before later dubbing him ‘Mick Junior’ as he moved up the ranks.</p>
                            <p>Born in 1999, at which point his father had won two of his eventual seven world championships, Mick Schumacher moved out of karts and into car racing in 2015 when he made his debut in German Formula 4. After a respectable but not outstanding rookie season, he placed second in both the German and Italian F4 series.</p>
                            <p>That prompted a move up into what was then called European F3. Schumacher consciously avoided promoting himself via his family name and was able to avoid massive press scrutiny during his first year in F3, finishing 12th. However, winning the title in his second year – via a fraught battle with Dan Ticktum – showed his achievements in his own right.</p>
                            <p>Schumacher moved up to Formula 2 in 2019 and the same year was signed to the Ferrari Driver Academy. he had his first Formula 1 test outing during the Bahrain in-season test, for the Scuderia and customer team Alfa Romeo. He posted encouraging times, coming second to Max Verstappen, despite being the lone rookie in the test.</p>
                            <p>He took his first Formula 2 victory during the sprint race in Hungary that year. He took pole position through the partial reverse grid, having finished eighth in Sunday’s feature race, and controlled the race to take a comfortable win. He ended the year 12th in the championship overall.</p>
                            <p>Ferrari intended to give Schumacher his first run in an official F1 practice session with customer team Alfa Romeo at the Nurburgring in 2020. However poor weather conditions forced the session, and Schumacher’s first run, to be abandoned.</p>
                            <p>He continued in F2 for a second season, where he was one of five Ferrari juniors in the field. Schumacher took a few races to mount his title bid while FDA rivals new Prema team mate Robert Shwartzman and Callum Ilott forged ahead in the early races.</p>
                            <p>But much as he had in F3, Schumacher came good in the second half of the season. He strung together an impressive run of podiums and added feature race wins at Monza and Sochi. That put him in the lead of the championship on 191 points, 22 more than second-placed Ilott, with four races in Bahrain to go.</p>
                            <p>Ilott put up a strong fight over the final weekends, and the title fight went down to the final race.</p>
                            <p>A tense finale saw both drivers slip out of the points-scoring positions as their tyres went off, and Schumacher clinched the title by 14 points</p>
                            <p>He went into the weekend secure in the knowledge he would be a Formula 1 driver in 2021, having signed to make his debut at Haas alongside fellow rookie Nikita Mazepin.</p>

                            <p>Haas announced Nikita Mazepin as part of an all-new driver line-up for the 2021 F1 season while the 21-year-old was still in contention for the Formula 2 title.</p>
                            <p>However he had already tested a Formula 1 car for the first time four years earlier, at Silverstone.</p>
                            <p>Mazepin’s international karting career culminated in second place in the 2014 CIK-FIA World Championship with Tony Kart. He moved up to single seaters that year, taking part in India-based Formula 2000 category MRF Challenge over the winter.</p>
                            <p>His next step was Formula Renault 2.0 and Toyota Winter Series campaigns though he struggled for results in both, finishing 12th and 16th respectively. A move to European F3 the following year looked like a hasty graduation, and Mazepin ended the year 20th in the standings. Nor did he distinguish himself with his conduct, throwing punches at rival Callum Ilott at the Hungaroring, which earned him a one-round ban.</p>
                            <p>Despite his mixed results, Mazepin was signed to Force India as a development driver in 2016 and completed a test at Silverstone.</p>

                            <p>A stellar Formula Two campaign in 2018 helped George Russell convince Williams he was ready for a promotion to Formula 1 even before the championship was decided</p>
                            <p>The 20-year-old already had six wins from the first 22 races, and might have had more had the series’ new-for-2018 hardware been more reliable in the opening races. He asserted himself over a competitive field including Lando Norris, who earned his promotion to McLaren the same year, and Alexander Albon, who took the title fight down to the final round.</p>
                            <p>Russell’s karting successes included victory in the 2012 CIK-FIA KF3 European championship with three wins from four starts, plus one no-score when he was taken out by a rival. He graduated to single-seaters in 2014.</p>
                            <p>He came from behind in the final round of the BRDC F4 championship to beat Arjun Maini to the title by three points with victory at Snetterton. One week earlier he also impressed as a wildcard entry in the Formula Renault Eurocup, beating newly-crowned champion Nyck de Vries to win the season finale at Jerez. Russell rounded off a successful first year in cars by winning the McLaren Autosport BRDC Award.</p>
                            <p>A promising first weekend in the European Formula Three championship with Carlin suggested he could be a title-contender. Russell won the second race of the season at Silverstone, but although he scored consistently Charles Leclerc, who took his first F3 win the same weekend, comfortably beat him to top rookie honours at the end of the year, while series veteran Felix Rosenqvist took the title</p>
                            <p>Russell returned for a second season F3 with new team Hitech against a substantially depleted field and the growing might of Prema. Lance Stroll served notice of his intentions by winning the opening race, and by the fourth round of the season he and Prema were increasingly stamping their authority on the championship. Russell managed a pair of wins and third in the standings.</p>
                            <p>A move to the F1 support bill the following year brought more success and the interest of Mercedes, who appointed him to their junior team. Joining the crack ART squad as part of a four-man assault on the GP3 title, Russell’s knack for converting pole positions into victories made him an irresistible championship prospect. He ended the year with an emphatic 79-point margin over his three team mates, led by Jack Aitken.</p>
                            <p>As well as making his F1 test debut for Mercedes, Russell made his first official F1 race weekend appearances for their customer team Force India. As he neared the end of his successful stint in F2 Russell grabbed a multi-year deal to drive for another Mercedes customer, Williams.</p>

                            <p>Nicholas Latifi made a relatively late start to his motor racing career. He started kart racing as a teenager.</p>
                            <p>But aided by backing from his father Michael Latifi, Nicholas moved up through the lower echelons of motor racing, eventually taking the runner-up spot in the 2019 Formula 2 championship. By this time he had attracted the interest of Williams, who promoted him to their Formula 1 line-up alongside George Russell for 2020.</p>

                        <p>Lewis Hamilton set himself on a path to Formula One when he introduced himself to McLaren team boss Ron Dennis at an award ceremony in 1995. The nine year-old walked up to Dennis, asked for his autograph and said: “Hi. I’m Lewis Hamilton. I won the British championship and one day I want to be racing your cars.”</p>
                        <p>It earned Hamilton the patronage and support of one of the top Formula One teams which, 13 years later, resulted in an F1 drive. Hamilton went on to equal and then outstrip the achievement of his hero Ayrton Senna, a former McLaren driver, by winning three championship titles.</p>
                        <p>Before that there was the small matter of graduating through the lower echelons of motorsport, which Hamilton achieved with some astonishing successes.</p>

                        <p>Valtteri Bottas made his Formula One race debut for Williams in 2013.</p>
                        <p>Bottas joined the team in 2010, taking over from Nico Hulkenberg as their test and reserve driver. After winning the 2011 GP3 championship he spent a year out of racing but appeared in practice sessions at official F1 weekends in 15 of the 20 rounds.</p>
                        <p>Bottas said this was the best preparation a young driver could get at the time due to the ban on in-season testing. The team were sufficiently impressed with his performance to drop Bruno Senna in favour of him at the end of 2012.</p>

                            <h1>Max Verstappen</h1>
                            <p>Max Verstappen caused a stir by gaining a place in Formula One just eight months after starting his first car race.</p>
                            <p>The son of Jos Verstappen, who was the first Dutchman to stand on a Formula One podium, and kart racer Sophie-Marie Kumpen, Max used a hugely successful karting campaign in 2013 as a springboard to start his single-seater racing career.</p>
                            <p>The elder Verstappen bowed out of F1 in 2003, and two years later seven-year-old Max scored his first karting victories in Belgium. This began a remarkable unbeaten streak running across three seasons, first in the Belgian ‘mini’ championship for two years, then after moving up to the ‘mini max’ category.</p>
                            <p>Further titles followed in 2008 including the Belgian Cadet Championship as Verstappen, now 11, began to ascend the karting ladder. A move up to the international level did little to put him off his stride, as he won the WSK World Series KF3 and the Euro title as well – the latter crown he retained the following year.</p>
                            <p>In 2012 he continued to compete across a variety of karting categories and enjoyed mixed success. But he came of age the following season, amassing a daunting collection of trophies. Among them were the CIK-FIA KZ world championship title, won against several highly-rated rivals including former F1 driver Jaime Alguersuari.</p>
                            <p>Verstappen added the KF and KZ European titles as well, lifted the WSK Euro Series KZ1 and WSK Master Series KZ2 crowns, and added the KF2 Winter Cup too. On the back of one of the most impressive karting campaigns of recent years Verstappen, who turned 16 that September, prepared to move up to slicks-and-wings racing.</p>
                            <p>His first stop was the 2014 Florida Winter Series, which comprised a dozen races run over four weeks at the beginning of the year. He made an inauspicious start when he crashed into Antonio Fuoco in the pits shortly after the first session started. But Verstappen won twice in a field which included drivers who had raced in Formula Renault 2.0 and Formula Three. Unusually, the series did not produce an overall champion, having no ranking system.</p>
                            <p>Those two categories were potential destinations for his 2014 campaign. Verstappen tested both machines, but following a highly promising run in a German Formula Three Cup car he chose to take the plunge in the most competitive Formula Three championship – the Europe-wide series.</p>
                            <p>Driving for the same Van Amersfoort team his father once raced for, the younger Verstappen won in his second F3 weekend. Soon after he hit a rich vein of form, reeling off six consecutive victories, all scored at Spa-Francorchamps and the Norisring.</p>
                            <p>A seventh straight win followed in the prestigious Masters of F3 on home ground at Zandvoort, though it didn’t count towards the championship. Verstappen’s Lotus-backed rival Esteban Ocon retained a 74-point lead in the drivers’ standings, partly thanks to superior reliability from his car. Ocon pulled over 100 points clear with a hat-trick of his own the following weekend in Moscow.</p>
                            <p>Verstappen failed to capitalise when Ocon endured a point-less weekend at the Red Bull Ring, due in part to a controversial penalty following contact with Antonio Fuoco. Red Bull, however, had seen enough of his potential to make their move.</p>
                            <p>Mercedes were also showing an interest in the young driver, but on August 12th Verstappen was announced as the latest addition to Red Bull’s junior driver programme. That roster already included two drivers who were leading their championships – Carlos Sainz Jnr in Formula Renault 3.5 and Alex Lynn in GP3 – plus promising Formula Renault 3.5 rookie Pierre Gasly.</p>
                            <p>But just six days after Red Bull revealed Verstappen had joined their ranks came the surprise announcement that he would race for their junior team Toro Rosso in 2015, replacing Jean-Eric Vergne. By the end of the year he had made three appearances in F1 practice sessions in preparation for his debut at the record-breaking age of 17.</p>

                            <h1>Alex Albon</h1>
                            <p>A strong Formula 2 campaign in 2018 earned Alexander Albon a chance to drive for Nissan’s Formula E team. But after the deal was announced Albon was surprisingly absent from pre-season testing amid rumours Formula 1 team Toro Rosso had made a late bid for his services.</p>
                            <p>Albon had previously been part of Red Bull’s Junior Team. He arrived in single-seaters after beginning his karting career at the age of eight. After moving up to the cadet class the following year he continued to ascend the karting ranks until 2011 when he narrowly lost the World Karting Championship to Nyck de Vries.</p>
                            <p>He lost his place on the Red Bull programme after a point-less first season in the Formula Renault 2.0 in 2012. However Albon moved to rival F1 team Lotus’s driver scheme, joining Esteban Ocon among others, and consistently improved over the coming years. He eventually finished runner-up to dominant Eurocup champion De Vries in 2014.</p>
                            <p>That paved the way for a move into European Formula Three where Albon partnered Dorian Boccolacci. He beat his Signature team mate by 160 points and finished in close company with fellow rookies George Russell and Lance Stroll, though some way behind fellow newcomer Charles Leclerc.</p>
                            <p>Albon and Leclerc got to know each other much better the following year when they teamed up with crack GP3 squad ART. Albon won more races than his team mate but lost the championship in the end due in part to Leclerc’s greater consistency.</p>
                            <p>The pair graduated to F2 the following year. Albon remained with ART, joining Nobuharu Matsushita, and began his first season well with points scores in all of his first eight starts. However he was forced to miss the Baku round due to injury.</p>
                            <p>Albon returned for a second season in 2018 with DAMS, starting from scratch again with a new team and the championship’s overhauled V6 turbo car. Albon emerged as a championship contender against the likes of Russell and Lando Norris, winning four times and taking the title fight against the former down to the final round. He slipped to third behind Norris in the final standings, but ended the year with four wins.</p>

                            <p>Lando Norris was appointed as McLaren’s test and reserve driver at the age of 17. An impressive performance for the team in testing at the Hungaroring in 2017 earned him the position in place of the team’s outgoing driver, 2009 world champion Jenson Button.</p>
                            <p>Like Button, Norris sampled a kart for the first time at Clay Pigeon kart track. Aged seven, Norris and his older brother Oliver (10), began competing in karting races soon afterwards.</p>
                            <p>The Norris boys enjoyed the backing of father Adam Norris, a director at financial services company Hargreaves Lansdown who later set up his own investment company. In 2016 he was estimated to have a wealth in excess of £200 million.</p>
                            <p>At one stage Lando Norris competed in both the KF and Rotax karting categories, at his father’s encouragement, to broaden his experience and give him a feel for different kinds of equipment and tyres. The intensive programme paid off and Lando delivered an impressive string of titles.</p>
                            <p>He clinched the 2013 WSK Euro series with a round to go. Although he missed out on the European KF title the following year he struck back in 2014, winning the world KF championship title.</p>

                            <p>Leading the Formula Renault 3.5 series in mid-2014, Sainz’s prospects looked very good. But the emerging talent of Formula Three driver Max Verstappen put a spanner in the works: Red Bull signed him up to their young driver programme alongside Sainz, and immediately gave Verstappen their sole vacant F1 seat at Toro Rosso for 2015.</p>

                            <h1>Sebastian Vettel</h1>
                            <p>Sebastian Vettel made astonishingly rapid and successful progress through the lower ranks of motorsport. In 2010 he became the youngest ever Formula One world champion and he has held on to the title ever since.</p>
                            <p>Vettel spent eight years in karts, winning the German Junior Karting Championship, Monaco Kart Cup and European Junior Karting Championship in 2001. The following year he was sixth in the Senior ICA Kart Championship and then moved into car racing.</p>
                            <p>He finished second in the 2003 Formula BMW Germany championship and was top rookie. The following year, aged 17, he emphatically won the title, taking 18 wins from 20 starts and 387 points from a maximum of 400.</p>
                            <p>The following season he was fifth in the Formula Three Euroseries. The championship was dominated by Lewis Hamilton and ASM – Vettel’s ASL team didn’t win a single race, though he was the top rookie.</p>
                            <p>Thanks to his BMW connections Vettel made his debut as an F1 tester for the Williams team. Still aged only 18, he had to ask his school teacher for time off to do the test.</p>
                            <p>The following year Vettel joined Paul di Resta at ASM but finished second to his team mate in the championship. A debut appearance in the World Series by Renault proved much more fruitful – Vettel won both races at Misano.</p>
                            <p>He also appeared at the next round at Spa but badly injured his hand in a 170mph crash. His right index finger was almost severed and had to be stitched back together.</p>

                            <p>Back-to-back championship successes in GP3 and Formula Two made Charles Leclerc an obvious choice for an F1 seat at Sauber in 2018.</p>
                            <p>He had his first run in a kart thanks to childhood friend Jules Bianchi. Leclerc, the younger of the pair by seven years, showed similar skills at the wheel and followed his friend’s path towards F1.</p>
                            <p>In 2009 Leclerc became the youngest-ever winner of France’s cadet karting championship. Two years later Nicolas Todt, Bianchi’s manager, signed Leclerc up. This was a pivotal moment, as without Todt’s backing Leclerc doubted his family could have afforded to keep supporting him.</p>
                            <p>He went on to enjoy success on the international stage, though he narrowly missed out on several major titles. In 2012 he was runner-up in the European KF2 series and the under 18 world championship. The following year Max Verstappen beat him to the KZ1 world title.</p>
                            <p>Nonetheless Leclerc showed clear potential and was ready to move up to racing cars. While Verstappen went straight into F3 Leclerc took smaller steps up the F1 ladder.</p>

                            <p>Daniel Ricciardo reached Formula One through Red Bull’s young driver programme. He was promoted to their F1 team in 2014 and scored three wins in his first year at the top team.</p>
                            <p>Ricciardo’s father was born in Sicily but emigrated to Australia at the age of eight. “I think Europe at the time was a bit difficult and a bit dark,” explained Ricciardo in 2017. “It was difficult to get ahead and I think they just thought Australia was a place of opportunity.”</p>
                            <p>However Ricciardo returned to Europe in order to make his way up the motor racing ladder. He won the British F3 championship in 2009 and progressed to Formula Renault 3.5 the following year. He finished two points behind champion Mikhail Aleshin following a setback late in the season when his car was flipped over at Silverstone.</p>
                            <p>Ricciardo drove for Red Bull in the post-season rookie test that year and again in 2010. He remained in Formula Renault 3.5 for 2011 but dovetailed it with increasing F1 commitments. This included participating in Friday first practice sessions for Red Bull’s sister team Toro Rosso.</p>

                            <p>Esteban Ocon was only 17 years old when he won the European Formula Three championship in 2014. Yet his even younger F3 rival Max Verstappen gained a place in Formula 1 more quickly, making his debut with Toro Rosso the following season.</p>
                            <p>Ocon had reached F3 after two season in Formula Renault 2.0, taking a strong second in the Eurocup in 2013 by winning two of the final three races. While Verstappen took a few rounds to come good and was hampered by some engine problems, Ocon put the championship beyond doubt with relentless points-scoring. In a 17-race period he finished in the top two 15 times.</p>
                            <p>After that Ocon made what appeared to be a sideways move into GP3. He had impressed Lotus in a one-off F1 practice outing for the team at the end of 2014, but needed to keep the results coming to sustain the interest of the top F1 teams.</p>

                            <p>Gasly was in his fourth year on Red Bull’s junior driver team. He began racing in the French Formula Four championship at the age of 15, finishing runner-up to Matthieu Vaxiviere and Andrea Pizzitola, then moved into Formula Renault 2.0.</p>
                            <p>His breakthrough came in his second year of racing in the Formula Renault 2.0 Eurocup. Gasly prevailed in a close and sometimes acrimonious season-long battle with Oliver Rowland. The pair collided in Russia and at the season finale at the Circuit de Catalunya. Rowland’s penalty for the latter collision sealed the title for Gasly.</p>

                            <p>Perez started karting in 1996. In 2004, with the support of prominent Mexican businessman Carlos Slim’s Escuderia Telmex, he began racing in the Skip Barber series in the USA.</p>
                            <p>The following year he moved to Europe and spent two years in the German Formula BMW championship.</p>
                            <p>Arriving in Britain in 2007 he raced for T-Sport, winning the national (junior) championship that year before graduating into the main series. He began his 2008 campaign strongly with three wins in the first six races, but faded to fourth by the end of the season.</p>
                            <p>He moved up to GP2 the following year, finishing on the podium in both races at Valencia and ending the year 12th. Switching from Arden to Addax he had a stronger 2010, but was beaten to the title by Pastor Maldonado.</p>
                            <p>Before the season was over he was signed by Sauber to partner Kamui Kobayashi in 2011. He also joined the driver development programme of Sauber’s engine supplier Ferrari.</p>

                            <h1>Lance Stroll</h1>
                            <p>Lance Stroll was a mere 11 years old when Ferrari signed him to their driver academy in 2010. From that point it seemed inevitable he would eventually make it into Formula One, but when the opportunity came it was with one of their rivals.</p>
                            <p>Stroll joined Williams as a development driver at the end of 2015 and gained a place in their race team two years later. It was a fitting move as Canada’s last F1 driver, Jacques Villeneuve, won the world championship with them in 1997.</p>
                            <p>In the intervening period Stroll’s path through the junior categories attracted positive and negative attention.</p>
                            <p>The latter arose chiefly from the investment of his father Lawrence Stroll, a billionaire who made his wealth through fashion brands such as Polo Ralph Lauren, Tommy Hilfiger and Michael Kors. His earnings, which had previously gone into amassing an enviable collection of Ferrari road cars, were now ploughed into his son’s racing career.</p>

                            <h1>Kimi Raikkonen</h1>
                            <p>Kimi Raikkonen started karting in 1987 and after several successes in the Finnish series moved up to compete at international level.</p>
                            <p>His first step into car racing was tentative: After a handful of starts in the 1999 British Formula Renault series he decided his Mygale chassis was too uncompetitive and returned to karting. He reappeared in Britain to compete in the Formula Ford Festival and then won the Formula Renault Winter Series.</p>
                            <p>That set him up for a return to Formula Renault with top team Manor. “Kimi had stayed in karts a long time,” team boss John Booth recalled, “mainly because he couldn’t raise the money to get out of it until the Robertsons got involved.” Dave and Steve Robertson, father and son, managed Raikkonen’s career.</p>
                            <p>Raikkonen started the season with third place and then a victory in the first two races. He added six more championships to clinch the title, and left the championship two races before the end of the season with the title already won.</p>

                            <p>Antonio Giovinazzi received a surprise call-up to make his Formula One race debut for Sauber on the eve of the first race of 2017. However the Italian driver had already impressively scaled the junior racing ranks and been hired by Ferrari as a test driver.</p>
                            <p>Born in the southern Italian town of Martina France, Giovinazzi enjoyed his first racing success in the Formula Pilota China series, winning the title with Eurasia. He also raced competitively closer to home in Formula Abarth and made the step up to F3 at the age of 19.</p>
                            <p>A dual campaign in the European and British championships meant he was kept busy, but results came slowly with Double R in the European series. He won twice in Britain and ended the year second overall behind Jordan King.</p>

                            <p>He joined Renault as test driver in 2008 after winning the 2007 Formula Three Euroseries. Grosjean had previously been one of the team’s Development Drivers.</p>
                            <p>He began his rise through the ranks winning the 2003 Swiss Formula Renault series with ten wins from as many starts. He then moved to French Formula Renault and was seventh in 2004 (with one win) and champion in 2005 (ten wins). He also took two podiums in the Formula Renault Eurocup at Valencia.</p>

                            <p>His father Jan Magnussen had begun an association with the same team 15 years earlier, leading to a single start for McLaren in the 1995 Pacific Grand Prix.</p>
                            <p>McLaren’s support led to him driving for the team at the 2012 and 2013 young drivers’ tests. They were sufficiently impressed with his potential that they took the surprising decision to drop Sergio Perez after a single season and promote Magnussen to their race team for 2014.</p>

                            <h1>George Russell</h1>
                            <p>A stellar Formula Two campaign in 2018 helped George Russell convince Williams he was ready for a promotion to Formula 1 even before the championship was decided</p>
                            <p>The 20-year-old already had six wins from the first 22 races, and might have had more had the series’ new-for-2018 hardware been more reliable in the opening races. He asserted himself over a competitive field including Lando Norris, who earned his promotion to McLaren the same year, and Alexander Albon, who took the title fight down to the final round.</p>
                            <p>Russell’s karting successes included victory in the 2012 CIK-FIA KF3 European championship with three wins from four starts, plus one no-score when he was taken out by a rival. He graduated to single-seaters in 2014.</p>
                            <p>He came from behind in the final round of the BRDC F4 championship to beat Arjun Maini to the title by three points with victory at Snetterton. One week earlier he also impressed as a wildcard entry in the Formula Renault Eurocup, beating newly-crowned champion Nyck de Vries to win the season finale at Jerez. Russell rounded off a successful first year in cars by winning the McLaren Autosport BRDC Award.</p>
                            <p>A promising first weekend in the European Formula Three championship with Carlin suggested he could be a title-contender. Russell won the second race of the season at Silverstone, but although he scored consistently Charles Leclerc, who took his first F3 win the same weekend, comfortably beat him to top rookie honours at the end of the year, while series veteran Felix Rosenqvist took the title</p>
                            <p>Russell returned for a second season F3 with new team Hitech against a substantially depleted field and the growing might of Prema. Lance Stroll served notice of his intentions by winning the opening race, and by the fourth round of the season he and Prema were increasingly stamping their authority on the championship. Russell managed a pair of wins and third in the standings.</p>
                            <p>A move to the F1 support bill the following year brought more success and the interest of Mercedes, who appointed him to their junior team. Joining the crack ART squad as part of a four-man assault on the GP3 title, Russell’s knack for converting pole positions into victories made him an irresistible championship prospect. He ended the year with an emphatic 79-point margin over his three team mates, led by Jack Aitken.</p>
                            <p>As well as making his F1 test debut for Mercedes, Russell made his first official F1 race weekend appearances for their customer team Force India. As he neared the end of his successful stint in F2 Russell grabbed a multi-year deal to drive for another Mercedes customer, Williams.</p>

                            <p>But aided by backing from his father Michael Latifi, Nicholas moved up through the lower echelons of motor racing, eventually taking the runner-up spot in the 2019 Formula 2 championship. By this time he had attracted the interest of Williams, who promoted him to their Formula 1 line-up alongside George Russell for 2020.</p>
